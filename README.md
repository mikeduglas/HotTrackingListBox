# Hot tracking listbox

Hot tracking is a feature that provides feedback to the user when the mouse pointer passes over the LIST control. With the Hot tracking property set to on, the LIST control responds to mouse movement by highlighting the row over which the mouse pointer is positioned. For a better understanding, [watch the short video]](https://clipchamp.com/watch/oScjswue4LD).

### Hot tracking listbox class
Adds the following functionality to LIST controls (those with FROM(Queue)):
- Hot tracking: highlight the row over which the mouse pointer is positioned.
- 3 predefined hot tracking modes: TextColor, Hyperlink and LightBox (all these modes can be seen in the video).
- Hover selection: automatically select a row when the mouse pointer remains over the row for a few seconds.
- Single click activation: use a single click instead of a double click (eg to call a form).
  
The class takes into account scrolling the list, filtering and reloading the queue.
